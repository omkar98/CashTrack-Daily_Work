= What is the suggested amount of packages to use? =

With regard to SBS Premium Version, there is no correct amount of packages to use.  You may choose to offer only one package for certain situations, but most people use between 3-6 packages.  To keep it simple, we recommend using up to 3 packages to not overburden your customer with decisions.

= What is the suggested amount of Step-By-Step pages to use? =

Up to 6 total steps for SBS Premium customers.  This means you can have 4 Category pages, 1 Options and Fees page and a Checkout page.  Or you can configure it to have 5 category pages and 1 checkout pages.  It's flexible and its totally up to you!  If you only need a couple category pages, then you can do that as well.

= What does Enable Catalog Pop-Ups Outside of Step-By-Step mean under General Settings? =

This enables catalog pop-ups outside of the Step-By-Step system. Clicking Product Images in catalogs opens a pop-up window instead of opening a new page. If enabled, this will apply to all WooCommerce shop pages, not just Step-By-Step.  Depending on how you want your store setup, you may want to have this enabled.

= What does the Hide Product Placeholder Images mean under general setting? =
